To use the Bullhorn REST API - you need to request access from
Bullhorn customer support.  They will create a specific user ID and
provide you with a Client ID and Client Secret.  You assign the
password for the user ID.  See the email below from Bullhorn 

The Client ID and Client Secret are required for authentication
(OAuth2) to use the REST API.  See the links in the email below for
more info and see Bullhorn.pm and the specific functions:
   get_auth_code
   get_access_token
   refresh_access_token
   check_access_token
   login





Hi Joe Developer,

Congratulations! Your setup to access the REST API is complete. Here
are your new credentials:

 
Client ID:     [CLIENT ID assigned by Bullhorn in the form of a UUID]
Client Secret: [CLIENT SECRET assigned by Bullhorn - long random string]
API Username:  [API User ID assigned by Bullhorn]
API Password: You will need to generate a password for your developer.

To do this:

     1. Log into Bullhorn and navigate to menu > tools > users
     2. Locate the username listed above in your userlist and open the
        user record.
     
     3. Generate a new password for the user and provide that password
        to your developer.
     

Note: You will still be required to use your API username and password
in the authentication process (included above).
